Draw is absolutely useless. Get Burke on #WBA
Come on Albion let me enjoy one Saturday night ay !!! #wba
Fabulous ball in from Phillips. About the first thing he's done. Excellent defending from Janmaat to deny Rod. #wba
Watford making substitutions. Pardew is currently more static than our midfield. Come on Al! Just change it up \u26bd\ufe0f #WBA
For any changes to make a difference surely Pardew has to do it now #wba
Worst striker up the Albion in the prem years. #wba https://t.co/p4srrdXSs9
Under Pulis we had no shots and no goals. Under Pardew we have lots of shots and no goals. The common denominator? #Rondon #wba
I Imagine Pardew is waiting for Watford to score before he brings Yacob on...#wba
Come on Pardew make a bloody change we can't cope since Okaka came on #wba
Seriously what is the purpose of Livermore just runs around the field then when he his involved he's useless #wba
